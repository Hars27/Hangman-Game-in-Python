# Hangman-Game-in-Python
an is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses. The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word. Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting the letters.The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the program writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of the hangman diagram as a tally mark.
